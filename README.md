# %mast

%mast is an Urbit-native reactive SSR Web framework. The new %mast component system lets you build a purely reactive component based UI on top of your Gall agent.

WIP

To test out %mast with the demo agent, copy the /desk files into a desk, boot the %demo agent, and go to your-ship-url/mast-demo in the browser.

```
> |new-desk %mast
> |mount %mast
% cp -r ~/path/to/repo/* ~/path/to/ship/mast/
> |rein %mast [& %mast]
> |revive %mast
```
