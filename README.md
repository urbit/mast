# %mast

%mast is an Urbit-native reactive SSR Web framework. The new %mast component system lets you build a purely reactive component based UI on top of your Gall agent.

WIP

To test out %mast with the demo agent, copy the /desk files into a desk, boot the %demo agent, and go to your-ship-url/mast-demo in the browser.

```
> |new-desk %mast-demo, =gall &
> |mount %mast-demo
% cp -r ~/path/to/repo/desk/* ~/path/to/ship/mast-demo/
> |revive %mast-demo
```
