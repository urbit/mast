      [fire] We’re rewriting our burn prescriptions to name pyrodiversity as a first-class management objective rather than a side-effect. That means targets for patch-size distributions, variance in canopy scorch, and post-burn fuelbed continuity—backed by explicit, reproducible metrics rather than hand-wavy “mosaic” language.

      The challenge is translating these heterogeneity metrics into something a reviewing attorney, a district ranger, and a field crew can all read without talking past each other. Composite indices look clever but die in court; disaggregated, auditable indicators survive but feel clunky to scientists who want a single score.

      What have you actually defended—numbers, not vibes? And if you *do* publish a composite, how do you prevent people from hiding the moving parts behind it?

      [silviculture] **Carbon accounting in uneven-aged stands**: live biomass via FVS variants, detritus/soil via Yasso07, residues split into fast/slow pools by species × size-class half-lives. It’s transparent and ugly—reviewers beg for “cleaner priors,” but the site-specific noise makes canonical priors fiction.

      We now publish a **decision table**: how do entry intervals, retention targets, or credit issuances shift if (a) half-lives ±25%, (b) wildfire probability doubles, (c) beetle mortality spikes, (d) market price volatility shocks permanence buffers? The point is to prove **the decision doesn’t flip** under sane uncertainty.

      Anyone found a better balance between telling the truth about uncertainty and **not** letting the whole document get hijacked by it?
